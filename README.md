# Securelay

A secure and ephemeral http-relay for small data.

# Features

**Ephemeral:** POST(s) and GET(s) can be concurrent. If not, POSTed data persists for a preset maximum period of time, say 24 hrs. Hence, Securelay is *ephemeral*, if not storageless.

**Duality:**

Securelay works in the following ways:
1. [Aggregator](## 'Public POST | Private GET') mode (**many-to-one**):
   Many can POST (or publish) to a public path for only one to GET (or subscribe) at a private path. POSTed data persist until next GET or expiry, whichever is earlier. This may be useful for aggregating HTML form data from one's users. Aggregated data is retrieved (GET) as a JSON array.
2. [Key-Value Store](## 'Private POST | Public GET') mode (one-to-many and one-to-one):
   - **one-to-many**: Only one can POST (or pub) to a private path for many to GET (or sub) at a public path. POSTed data persists till expiry. Expiry may be refreshed with a PATCH request at the private path, with no body. See the [Security](#security) section below for a significant usecase of this mode. Also see **CDN and password-protection** below for more details.
   - **one-to-one:** If path is suffixed with a user-given unique id `<uid>`. POSTed data persists until next GET or expiry, whichever is earlier. That is to say, when one POSTs to `https://securelay.tld/<private_path>/<uid>`, there can be only one GET consumer at `https://securelay.tld/<public_path>/<uid>`, after which any more GET at that path would result in a 404 error. This is useful for sending a separate response to each POSTer.

**Metadata**: Securelay adds metadata to the posted data. Metadata consists of a unique id (`id`), (Unix) timestamp of when the data was posted (`time`).

**CDN and password-protection**: The one-to-many key-value store mode described above operates in two ways:

1. CDN: Data posted at a private path that is truly meant to be public is served over a [CDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN) download-link. Due to cache-refresh time of CDN, any changes in the data (update/deletion) should take some time to reflect in the download link. In this mode, any GET at the publc path simply redirects to the CDN link. Data served over CDN persists longer, say for a month.

2. Password: Data posted at a private path may be protected with a password, simply by using a query string `?password=<secret>`. This data can be retrieved only with a GET at the public path, provided the same query string (i.e. password) is used during download. This type of data is ephemeral (e.g. 1-day retention). However, every download might automatically extend the expiry by 1 more day to retain oft requested data.

**Webhooks:** Private GET requests can optionally send a webhook URL using [query parameter `hook`](## '`?hook=<percent-encoded-URL>`'). The webhook URL is cached by the Securelay server for a preset [TTL](## 'Time To Live'). Subsequent public POSTs will be delivered (POST) to the cached webhook. The webhook URL will be [decached](## 'deleted from cache') if:
1. Attempted delivery to the webhook during a public POST fails.
2. A private GET does not resend the webhook URL with query `hook`.

Note that since the webhook URL can be sent only with the private path, it is never exposed to the public. So, you can safely pass a webhook URL containing, say, secret credentials.

Public POSTs respond with whether a webhook was used or not as `webhook: <boolean>`. They do not, however, reveal the webhook URL. 

**Custom redirects:** All allowed POST requests support optional query strings of the form: `?ok=<URL1>&err=<URL2>`. If the request is successful, a [`303`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/303) redirect to `URL1` is sent, instead of the usual status code [`200`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200). On any failure, on the other hand, a `303` redirect to `URL2` is issued. Among other benefits, this helps provide user-friendly response when the user POSTs using HTML form submissions. Note: `<URL>` above denotes the [percent-encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/) `URL`.

**CORS:** Allowing CORS is a must. Otherwise, browsers would block client side calls to the API. So securelay server replies with the HEADER- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

**Futureproof:** The URL(s) of the API endpoint(s) may be found with a GET at https://securelay.github.io/api/endpoints.json or https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/securelay/api/endpoints.json courtesy of [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh). So it acts as a sort of dynamic DNS. This requires storing the list of URLs in minified JSON format in an `endpoints.json` file in the https://github.com/securelay/api repository. The format is `{"<id>":["<url1>","<url2>", ...], ...}` where `<id>` is a hash of the server secret. Having the same secret essentially means that one endpoint recognizes keys generated by the other. This also means that the endpoints, say `url1` and `url2`, share the same database; i.e. a post at `url1` may be retrieved at `url2`. URLs with the same `<id>` are interchangeable, and may be used for load balancing. Also, if an endpoint changes only its domain name, its `<id>` should persist! This helps prevent domain lock-in thus keeping domain costs lower for the Securelay service provider. Every endpoint reports its `<id>` to a GET request at path `/id`.

**Streams or Piping**: POST or PUT at public (private) paths are piped to GET at corresponding private (public) path provided the paths are prefixed with `/pipe/`. Data here is streamed live from the sender to the receiver and not stored, even ephemerally. Essentially, the Securelay server redirects ([`307`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307)) to a http-relay service such as [piping-server](https://github.com/nwtgck/piping-server) or [httprelay.io](https://httprelay.io/), with a unique path. The redirect URLs are valid for a preset TTL of, say, 60 seconds. A receiver (sender) waits for the corresponding sender (receiver) to connect, if not already found. The waiting period should not exceed the abovementioned TTL of the redirect URLs. Currently, the implementations, if any, depend on the availability of such 3rd party http-relays for this feature to work. If the 3rd party http-relay allows for it, there may not be any limit on the size of the piped data.

**Web-push notifications for registered apps**: A developer using Securelay as backend may register her app (`<app>`)  at https://github.com/securelay/apps. Upon receiving any POST at the public path *with query string `?app=<app>`* , Securelay sends a web-push using [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com) and the registered settings. To target the user, Securelay uses the public key as [OneSignal external_id](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#external-id). The frontend can simply use the [OneSignal SDK](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/web-sdk-reference) to register the user for the web-push. It, however, needs a OneSignal `appId` to  initiate the SDK. This is available from Securelay with a GET at url: `/id?app=<app>`. For illustration, see the [Formonit](https://formonit.github.io) project that uses Securelay as backend.

# Security
Security is brought about by the use of dual paths, one private and the other public, for posting (POST) and retrieving (GET) data. Public path is derivable from private path but not the other way round. Compare this with other http-relay services like [piping-server](https://github.com/nwtgck/piping-server), [http-relay](https://httprelay.io) or [pipeto.me](https://pipeto.me) which use the same path for both GET and POST.

Note that Securelay doesn't require any API key for protecting data. The private path itself serves as one. Data can be overwritten only by the owner of the private path.

Another part of security is in ensuring that no two users can have the same private path, even by accident. Securelay achieves this by accepting only those paths that were uniquely generated and signed by the Securelay server itself!

Although Securelay can read the user data in principle, users can easily make the relay end-to-end-encrypted with the following strategy. One can simply POST his cryptographic public key at his private path for his users to consume at the corresponding public path. His users would then POST at the public path their data encrypted with that public key, for him to decrypt upon a subsequent GET at the private path!

# Implementation details
A GET to `https://securelay.tld/keys` returns a new private-public key-pair as JSON: `{"private":"<private_key>","public":"<public_key>"}`.

`private_key` gives the private path as `/private/<private_key>`.

`public_key` gives the public path as `/public/<public_key>`.

A key, private or public, is generated as `sign(<random> + <type>) + <random>`. `<type>` denotes the type of the key, i.e. 'private' or 'public' and `+` denotes concatenation. `<random>` denotes a random string (discussed below). Note: `<random>` is a substring of the key.

The `sign(arg)` function is implemented as `substring(hmac(arg, <secret>))` where `<secret>` is some random string known only to the Securelay server. For the sake of [futureproofing](#features), `<secret>` may be related to the database used. Secret, therefore, may be chosen as some hash of the database credentials.

`<random>`, in case of private key, is `substring(hash(<UUID>))` where `<UUID>` is a [version 4 UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)).

`<random>`, in case of public key, is `substring(hash(<random of private_key>))`.

SHA256 or MD5 may be used for both `hash` and `hmac` above.

Substrings are used above only to keep the key length short.

Note that given any key, it is trivial to determine whether it is public or private just by validating its signature. A GET at `https://securelay.tld/keys/<key>` returns information about the `<key>` in JSON format. If the provided key is private, it's public key is also returned.

Public paths are prefixed with `/public` and private paths with `/private` mainly for the sake of readability of user code.

# Limits
To mitigate abuse, the API might impose the following restrictions.

- Accepts and validates only these `Content-Type`s.
   - application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   - application/json
   - text/plain

- Accepts POSTs only if they have `Content-Length` less than a size-limit (`default`: 10 kiB). This may not apply for POST/PUT at path `/pipe/...`.

- Retains POSTed data until (retrieved or) expiry (`default TTL`: 24 hrs).

- Rate-limits requests. After a certain number of 429 responses 403 bans may be imposed. [404s may also be rate limited](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-rate-limit?tab=readme-ov-file#preventing-guessing-of-urls-through-404s).

- Blocks offending IPs.

- Redirect URLs for `/pipe/` requests are valid for a certain TTL (`default:` 60 seconds).

- For any given key and method (`GET` | `POST` | `PUT`), requests at `/pipe/<key>` can generate a certain maximum number (`default`: 5) of unique redirect URLs.

# Use cases
- Form backend (in [aggregator](#features) mode).
- Comments store (in [aggregator](#features) mode).
- Likes/page-views/votes/clicks aggregator/counter (in [aggregator](#features) mode).
- Chats (in [one-to-one & aggregator](#features) mode).
- PubSub (in [one-to-many](#features) or key-value-store & [aggregator](#features) mode).
- Dynamic Key Value Store; values against a public key can be updated and even deleted (using the private path). For custom keys, [one-to-one](#features) mode may be used.
- Dynamic DNS (in [key-value-store](#features) mode). This is also useful for publishing dynamic relay IPs (such as provided by [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and other [port-forwarders](https://gist.github.com/SomajitDey/efd8f449a349bcd918c120f37e67ac00)) that expose nodes behind NAT.
- Single click URL shortener (in [one-to-one](#features) mode).
- Configuration sharing between microservices.
- WebRTC signaling server or peer-to-peer (p2p) connector.
- Request bin / http-bin (in [aggregator](#features) mode).
- Secure p2p tunneling (using the [streams/piping feature](#features) @ `/pipe/` paths).
- Hosting a rate-limited public webhook-server behind NAT (see [example](#api)).

# Model implementations
See repositories starting with `api-` in the [securelay](https://github.com/securelay) GitHub organization.
These implementations are not necessarily complete. [This](https://github.com/securelay/api-serverless-redis-vercel) serverless implementation is the most actively maintained. See [this](https://formonit.github.io) project for an example use case of Securelay as backend.

# Future directions
- Accept `?verify=<email>` query parameter when requesting the key-pair at `https://securelay.tld/keys`. This prompts Securelay to send an ephemeral nonce to the provided email. On presenting this nonce on a subsequent key-pair request with the query `?email=<email>&nonce=<nonce>&salt=<custom>` generates the desired key-pair. The `<random>` used to create the private key in this key-pair is : `hash(<email>+<custom>)`. So, basically it deterministically maps a *verified* email and a user-chosen salt to a private key. Even if the user loses his private key, he can easily retrieve it by verifying his email.

- Accept `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`.

- Enable push notifications to subscribing private key owners. *n* times a day the subscribers may be fed the same information that is available with `?stats` query during GET at the private path.

- Support configuring the max number of concurrent streams. This may be done using a query parameter (`?max`) at the private path.

# API
The following documents the API by using `curl` and the original Securelay server: https://securelay.vercel.app as example. POSTs in the following examples have `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

**Note:** [Here](https://securelay.github.io/api/script.js) is a **JavaScript module (SDK)** to access the API.

### Generate new key-pair
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/keys
```
Returns: `{"private":"3zTryeMxkq","public":"w_1uSAakuZ"}`

### Check key type
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/keys/w_1uSAakuZ
```
Returns: `{"type":"public"}`

```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/keys/3zTryeMxkq
```
Returns: `{"type":"private","public":"w_1uSAakuZ"}`

### Many to One Relay
**POST at public path**:
```bash
curl -d 'data=This+is+data1' https://securelay.vercel.app/public/w_1uSAakuZ;
curl -d 'data=This+is+data2' https://securelay.vercel.app/public/w_1uSAakuZ;
```
Returns:
> `{"message":"Done","error":"Ok","statusCode":200,"webhook":false}`

Note:

The `webhook` value in the response is a Boolean stating whether the posted data was transferred via a webhook. If false, posted data remains available for GET at private path.

**GET at private path**:
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq
```
Returns:
> `[{"id":"AYqNL","time":1736920876170,"data":{"data":"This is data1"}},{"id":"7q_n3","time":1736920880457,"data":{"data":"This is data2"}}]`

Note:

The response is a JSON array. Each element is a JSON containing an `id` to uniquely identify the message, `time` containing the Unix time the message was posted, and `data` containing the message.

### One to Many Relay
**POST at private path**:
```bash
curl -d 'msg=This+is+a+public+notice' https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq
```
Returns: `{"message":"Done","error":"Ok","statusCode":200, "cdn":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/securelay/jsonbin@main/alz2h/w_1uSAakuZ.json"}`

However, providing a password bypasses CDN:
```bash
curl -d 'msg=This+is+a+secret+notice' https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq?password=secret
```
Returns: `{"message":"Done","error":"Ok","statusCode":200}`

**GET at public path**:
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/public/w_1uSAakuZ
```
Redirects ([301](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301)) to the CDN link: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/securelay/jsonbin@main/alz2h/w_1uSAakuZ.json.

However, providing a password as:
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/public/w_1uSAakuZ?password=secret
```
Returns: `{"id":"yW40d","time":1736921771281,"data":{"msg":"This is a secret notice"}}`

Refresh expiry with PATCH at private path:
```bash
curl -X PATCH https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq
```
Returns: `{"message":"Done","error":"Ok","statusCode":200, "cdn":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/securelay/jsonbin@main/alz2h/w_1uSAakuZ.json"}` even if there is no data!

To refresh password protected data simply add the query `?password` (no need to pass the actual value of the password as the private key takes care of the authentication):
```bash
curl -X PATCH https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq?password
```
Returns: `{"message":"Done","error":"Ok","statusCode":200}`

Note: Retrieving password protected data autorefreshes it.

DELETE at private path (unpublishes from CDN):
```bash
curl -X DELETE https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq
```
Returns: [`204 No Content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204)

To delete the password protected data simply add the query `?password`.

### Stats
GET at private path with query string `?stats` gives number of public POSTs waiting to be retrieved (consumed), which have not expired yet. It also gives the remaining TTL (in seconds) for those data as well as the data last published with POST at the private path. TTL value of 0 would mean data has either been consumed or has expired.
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq?stats
```
Returns: `{"count":2,"ttl":86395}`

### One to One Relay
**POST at private path with some custom field (any random string)**:
```bash
curl -d 'msg=This+is+a+private+notice' https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq/anyRandString

curl -d 'msg=This+is+another+private+notice' https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq/anotherRandString
```
Returns: `{"message":"Done","error":"Ok","statusCode":200}`

**Check TTL (in seconds) of one-to-one data** (value 0 would mean data has either been consumed or has expired):
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq/anyRandString
```
Returns: `{"ttl":86397}`

**GET at public path with some custom field**:
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/public/w_1uSAakuZ/anyRandString
```
Returns: `{"id":"OL0UR","time":1736921895206,"data":{"msg":"This is a private notice"}}`

```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/public/w_1uSAakuZ/anotherRandString
```
Returns: `{"id":"aChYU","time":1736921895208,"data":{"msg":"This is another private notice"}}`

### Get endpoint's ID
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/id
```
Returns: `alz2h`

### Webhooks
Open two terminals: A and B.

A. At terminal A, set up a webhook with URL https://ppng.io/3zTryeMxkq as follows:
```bash
while curl -f https://ppng.io/3zTryeMxkq; do :; done
```
B. At terminal B:
```bash
# Let Securelay know about your webhook URL
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/private/3zTryeMxkq?hook=https%3A%2F%2Fppng.io%2F3zTryeMxkq

# Make a public POST
curl -d 'data=This+is+data' https://securelay.vercel.app/public/w_1uSAakuZ
```
Terminal A should output: `{"id":"lwjHI","time":1736921992377,"data":{"data":"This is data"}}`

### Custom redirects
Applicable for all allowed POST requests. Example:
```bash
curl -i -d 'data=This+is+data' 'https://securelay.vercel.app/public/w_1uSAakuZ?ok=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&err=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F404.html'
```

### Get OneSignal appId for the endpoint
```bash
curl https://securelay.vercel.app/id?app=formonit
```
Returns: `<ONESIGNAL_APP_ID>`.

### Streams/Piping
Note: This feature is experimental and depends on the availability of 3rd party service(s).

Open two terminals A and B. In terminal A, POST (or PUT) to public path `/pipe/w_1uSAakuZ`, while at terminal B GET from private path `/pipe/3zTryeMxkq`. POSTed data is transferred as stream (i.e. piped) without being stored in the server.

Terminal A:
```bash
curl -L -i -d 'data=hello+world' https://securelay.vercel.app/pipe/w_1uSAakuZ
```
Terminal B:
```bash
curl -L -i https://securelay.vercel.app/pipe/3zTryeMxkq
```

Note: `-L` option is used above to allow `curl` to follow the redirects.

Similarly for POST/PUT at private path and GET at public.

One can, for example, run a webhook server, even behind NAT, as:
```bash
while true; do timeout 60 curl -L https://securelay.vercel.app/pipe/3zTryeMxkq; echo; done
```
with its public endpoint URL being the corresponding public path: `https://securelay.vercel.app/pipe/w_1uSAakuZ`.
